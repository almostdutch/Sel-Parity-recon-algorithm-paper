# Sel-Parity-recon-algorithm-paper
MATLAB implementation of two selective parity reconstruction algorithms from the paper Non-CPMG diffusion-weighted turbo spin-echo imaging using the selective parity approach (Aidin Arbabi, Vitaliy Khlebnikov, José P. Marques, and David G Norris). 
<br/>The best way to getting started is to read "readme.docs" file for each of the algorithm.<br/>

Folder “matlabStuff” has the following dependencies:
- FID-A-master: scripts for reading Siemens raw “*.dat” files.
Available from https://github.com/CIC-methods/FID-A
- SPIRiT_v0.3: scripts for estimating the non-acquired k-space lines with CG-SPIRIT.
Available from https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/Software.html. An alternative is to use POCS-SPIRIT implemented in-house.
