# Sel-Parity-recon-algorithm-paper
MATLAB implementation of two selective parity reconstruction algorithms from the paper Non-CPMG diffusion-weighted turbo spin-echo imaging using the selective parity approach (Aidin Arbabi, Vitaliy Khlebnikov, Jos√© P. Marques, and David G Norris). The best way to getting started is to read "readme.docs" file for each of the algorithm.
